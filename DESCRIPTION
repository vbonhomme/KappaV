Description: this package allows to quantify the congruence between two patchy
    mosaics or landscapes. This "vectorial Kappa" approach extends the
    principle of Cohen's Kappa index by calculating areas of intersected
    patches between two mosaics rather than agreement between pixels. It
    provides an exact alternative for patchy mosaics when a Kappa index is
    needed.
